# Development

Follow the setup instructions in [BUILD.md](BUILD.md), and then:

1. `npm install -g live-server`
2. `live-server dist/``

This will open up a browser window with the `dist` directory contents displayed.

# Live reload

In a separate window, run:

1. `npm run watch`

Then whenever a file is edited, it will be re-compiled and available for reloading.
